<h1>From Numbers to Code: A Journey of Transformation</h1>
<hr>
<p>At 47 , I am a seasoned bookkeeper with a wealth of experience in managing finances and working on EU projects. 
  My career has been a fulfilling one, filled with meticulous calculations, financial planning, and ensuring compliance with complex regulations.
  However, as the digital age continues to evolve, I've recently discovered a passion for web development.</p>

<p>For years, I have been the backbone of financial operations, ensuring that every euro is accounted for and every project is financially sound.
  My expertise in bookkeeping has not only helped businesses thrive but also contributed to the successful implementation of numerous EU-funded initiatives.
  Yet, the allure of creating something new, something digital, has sparked a new passion within me.</p>

<p>The decision to transition from bookkeeping to web development is not one I take lightly.
  It is a journey that requires learning new skills, embracing new technologies, and stepping out of my comfort zone.
  But it is also a journey that excites me. The idea of building websites, creating digital experiences, 
  and contributing to the online world is a challenge I am eager to take on.</p>

<p>Transitioning from bookkeeping to web development is a big step, but it's one I'm excited about.
  I bring the same dedication and attention to detail to learning coding and design principles.</p>

<p>This journey is about growth and embracing the future. 
  I look forward to combining my financial expertise with web development skills to create unique and impactful digital solutions.
  Join me as I transform from a bookkeeper to a web developer, building a bridge between my past experiences and future aspirations.</p>
